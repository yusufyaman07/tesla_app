# Tesla App:
In this project, which I created using React-Native components and style structure, the image, title and description text of each vehicle are rendered to the screen.



# Features:
- In this application, which creates a screen for each vehicle according to the car data in the created car.js file, each page includes the image, description and title features of that vehicle.
- I achieved a great look in terms of style in this application, which has performance improvement with Flatlist.
- A cleaner code structure was obtained with components.
